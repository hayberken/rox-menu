			Menu
			A simple menu applet for the ROX panel.
			by Ken Hayber and Christopher Arndt

Brief
~~~~~
Menu provides a start menu for all your ROX applications on the ROX panel.

It will examine the directory containing your ROX applications (default ~/Apps),
recursively reading all subdirectories, and build a matching menu tree. It will
then display an icon on the panel. Click on the icon to access the menu.

Subdirectories will appear as submenus of your main menu so you can organize
your application collection nicely. Empty directories are ignored and do not
appear in the menu. All other files (excluding those whose names begin with a
dot) appear as normal menu entries. When you choose an item from the menu, the
file it points to will be opened by the ROX filer. This allows you to put any
file type that ROX can handle in the menu, not just applications.
